## Overview
Our Project called “NewsFlash” is a social media application. Users can login using their login information or make a new account. Users can scroll to view other peoples posts where they can like/dislike/retweet/comment. Users can also search for other usernames. Users are able to create posts/polls for others to see. Users can also edit and change their own profile.

The purpose of our application is to have users be able to post about their day in a unique way. Once a user posts, it’s formatted to look like a news article, so all of their friends and followers can scroll through everyone’s day as if it’s a newspaper. There is also a separate section for polling, for an extra level of interactivity to your day-to-day interactions with the people around you. 

Newsflash is the perfect app to share your day with your friends, family, or any other audience you wish. The newspaper format is fresh, and just slightly nostalgic of the times of reclining on the armchair, with the Sunday special in your hands.
